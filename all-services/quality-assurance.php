        <div>
            Failure Testing: Also referred to as stress testing, failure testing is a way to push a product to its limits by increasing vibration, temperature, humidity, etc., to expose inherent weaknesses, and then use those findings to improve the product to uphold a higher standard.
            Statistical Control: This type of quality assurance is based on analyses of objective and subjective data to track quality data, and then chart it against a common cause variance.
            Total Quality Management: Here the quality of the product is dependent on the participating constituents, some sustainable and controllable, others not. If the specification does not match its true quality requirements, then the quality is not guaranteed.
            Models and Standards: This is an international standard that has general requirements for competence. There are tests to carry out, 15 management requirements and 10 technical requirements, in a laboratory that is accredited.
            Company Quality: This concept came about in the 1980s and focuses on all departments approaching quality lead by management to develop a quality improvement process. This is done through controls, job management, process, performance, knowledge, skills and experience, integrity, confidence and infrastructure.
